Redcell is an Infrastructure as Code Lab of red teamers operations , it's built using Vagrant and Ansible , and it can be deployed and run locally .
This lab is made of six virtual machines that seems necessary for the Cyber Kill Chain steps :

- **scanVM** running kali-Linux machine with needed tools like Nmap , dirsearch , ...

- **crackVM** running Ubuntu machine with Hashcat tool installed

- **covenantVM** running ubuntu machine with _Covenant C2_ tool installed and running on port 7443 .

- **covenantRedirector** running ubuntu machine with nginx redirector and behaving as a _reverse proxy_ for the _covenantVM_ C2 machine .

- **phishingVM running** ubuntu machine with gophish tool installed and running on ports 3333 and 80 .

- **gophishRedirector** running ubuntu machine with nginx redirector and behaving as a _reverse proxy_ for the _phishingVM_ machine .

The lab setup is automated using vagrant and ansible automation tools.
